<h1>You Are ot Alone: The Prospect Is Imaginary</h1>
<h2>At the heart of all things, there is a mystery which makes them so.</h2>

<p>You are this ineffable presence, yet you imagine yourself something else. The reason for this is simple: only through separation can there be things to do. This vast cosmos is art for its own sake.</p>
<p>The ego fears reunification because it appears to be the death of the small "individual" self. The ego is not right but it is also not wrong.</p>
<p>Are you a drop of water or the stuff of Ocean?</p>
